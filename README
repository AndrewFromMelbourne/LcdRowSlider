The LcdRowSlider library is a templated class that uses the LiquidCrystal
library (or similar) and the user defineable characters (via createChar) to
provide a slider that extends across a number of columns and can display
five different levels per column. For example in a 16x2 LCD display the
slider can have up to 80 different levels (not including zero). While the
code is reasonably general, it does assume a 5x8 pixel LCD character.

To use the code you need to create an LcdRowSlider object, using the
specific class that implements the calls to the LCD. For example to use the
class with the standard LiquidCrystal class you create the object like this.

    LiquidCrystal lcd(8, 9, 4, 5, 6, 7);
    LcdRowSlider<LiquidCrystal> lcdRowSlider(lcd, 0, 80, 1);

The advantage of using a template is that you can use any LiquidCrystal
library with this class. For example LiquidCrystal_I2C.

To use the code you need to create an LcdRowSlider object. The constructor
take the following parameters:-

    LiquidCrystal_T& lcd

        An object of the class you are using to drive the LCD.

    int32_t min

        The minimum value of the slider

    int32_t max

        The maximum value of the slider

    uint8_t row

        The display row where the slider will be drawn

    uint8_t firstColumn 
    
        The first column of the slider (default is 0)

    uint8_t lastColumn

        The last column of the slider (default is 15)

The methods are as follows:

    void value(int32_t value);

        Set the slider to 'value', scaled between min and max.

    void unscaled(uint8_t value);

        The unscaled method allows you to to set the slider to a specific
        level without using a scale between min and max. For example if the
        slider is over 16 columns the graph can have an unscaled value
        between 0 and 79.

    uint8_t getRow() const;

        Returns the row number where the slider will be displayed

    int32_t getMin() const;

        Get the minimum value that the slider is mapped to.

    int32_t getMax() const;

        Get the maximum value that the slider is mapped to.

    void setMinMax(int32_t min, int32_t max);

        Set the minimum and maximum values that the slider is mapped to.
